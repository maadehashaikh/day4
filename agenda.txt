Middleware

hamesha routes say pehly lagta h , jab bh server request accept karta h wahn say route kay bech poachny tak agar ap us request ko bech mai rok kay kuch perform karty ho to yeh element is called Middleware , 
Middleware bech ka part h and server apna msg usko bhej dayta h direct route ko nh so middleware yeh msg kary ga kay kis client ny yeh reuqest bheji thi , middleware ki help say hm bta skty hain kay user h kon ? yeh kam kar skta h aisay !! 
app.use() => aik middleware h and yeh kehta h kay route ko response bhejny say pehly ap mujhy chalao
filhal we don't understand what will be the work but yes there's something we want that jo hmaray pass response anay say pehly ho and isi liyay hmny middleware bnaya h
